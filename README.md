example_for_git
Here I am adding examples for how to edit files in git. i also made changes to readme file.

currently there is only one file in my example git repository: diffG34MB_UBCref.R
# diffG34MB_UBCref.R
This is a R file I made to model UBC single cell reference based on tumor derived GEP and then projected tumor data onto the UBC reference.
